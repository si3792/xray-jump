## Xray-Jump settings

Xray-Jump adds these commands:

* `xrayJump.activate`: which activates Xray-Jump
* `xrayJump.activateWithSelection`: like `xrayJump.activate` but will make a selection from the current cursor position to the new cursor position

**Note** No keybinding is provided by this extension. You have to create one yourself.
